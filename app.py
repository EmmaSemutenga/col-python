#which to insert, so a.insert(0, x) 
#inserts at the front of the list, and a.insert(len(a), x) is equivalent to a.append(x).

#  a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list. (The square brackets around 
# the i in the method signature denote that the parameter is optional, not that you 
# should type square brackets at that position. You will see this notation frequently 
# in the Python Library Reference.
#also returns the value that has been removed

#list.clear()
#Remove all items from the list. Equivalent to del a[:].
