#You will notice that methods like insert, remove or sort

#Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable(anything that can be looped)

#Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of the element before 
#which to insert, so a.insert(0, x) 
#inserts at the front of the list, and a.insert(len(a), x) is equivalent to a.append(x).

#Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified,
#  a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list. (The square brackets around 
# the i in the method signature denote that the parameter is optional, not that you 
# should type square brackets at that position. You will see this notation frequently 
# in the Python Library Reference.
#also returns the value that has been removed

#list.clear()
#Remove all items from the list. Equivalent to del a[:].

#Return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value is x. Raises a ValueError if there is no such item.

#using lists as stacks (last in first out by using .appen() and .pop() respectively)

#using Lists as queues (first in first out), lists are not efficient for this purpose i.e doing inserts and pops at the begining is slow


#To implement a queue, use collections.deque which was designed to have fast appends and pops from both ends.

queue.popleft()                 # The second to arrive now leaves

print(list(queue))                           # Remaining queue in order of arrival, also coverted it into a list
